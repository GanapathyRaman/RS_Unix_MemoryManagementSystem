RS_Unix_MemoryManagementSystem
==============================

It is proposed to develop a memory management system that would allocate and manage pools of memory on the heap. Typical operations that the memory management system would support include allocation/deallocation of memory pools, allocation/deallocation of memory chunks, and viewing the status and contents of pools.
